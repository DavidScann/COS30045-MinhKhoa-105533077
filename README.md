# Audience
This project is intended to be a visualisation of the data provided by **energyrating.gov.au**, displaying information about energy efficiency of Televisions as well as several other information regarding the electrical use of Televisions in Australia and nearby regions. This is meant to be a project to assist those who are interested in data as well as the effiency of Televisions and electricity in general (conservationists).

## Data Story

### About the Data

#### Data Source
The dataset used in this project was obtained from **energyrating.gov.au**, an official Australian government website that publishes information related to energy efficiency ratings. The data is publicly accessible and intended for transparency and research purposes.

#### Data Processing
All data processing and transformation were performed using **KNIME**. This included importing raw datasets, cleaning inconsistent or missing values, restructuring fields for analysis, and preparing the data for downstream exploration and visualization. KNIME was chosen for its reproducibility, visual workflow design, and suitability for data preparation tasks.

#### Privacy
The dataset does not contain personally identifiable information (PII). All records relate to products or aggregated measurements rather than individuals. As the data is publicly released and anonymised at the source, no additional privacy-preserving transformations were required during processing.

#### Accuracy and Limitations
The dataset contains missing and incomplete values, which required cleaning and filtering. As a result:

- Accuracy varies across records depending on data completeness.
- Some entries may be excluded from analysis due to insufficient information.
- Conclusions drawn from the data should be interpreted with caution, especially where missing values could introduce bias.

Additionally, the dataset reflects the information available at the time of publication on energyrating.gov.au and may not represent the most current ratings or product updates.

#### Ethics
This project uses publicly available government data for analytical and educational purposes. No attempts were made to re-identify individuals or infer sensitive information. The analysis avoids misleading representations and acknowledges uncertainty and data quality limitations where applicable. Ethical use is maintained by clearly documenting assumptions, transformations, and known constraints of the dataset.
